# AWS X-Ray Documentation

AWS X-Ray is a service that enables you to trace requests made to your application in distributed systems, making it easier to identify infrastructure issues and measure the time taken for each request. It is widely used in microservices-based applications.

---

## What is AWS X-Ray?

AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can:

- Trace requests as they travel through your application.
- Identify bottlenecks and performance issues.
- Gain insights into the behavior of your application.

## Getting Started with AWS X-Ray in Python

### Example: Enabling X-Ray for Popular Libraries

The following example demonstrates how to enable AWS X-Ray to automatically monitor popular libraries in your Python application:

```python
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
from aws_xray_sdk.core import patch_all

# Enable X-Ray to monitor popular libraries automatically
patch_all()
```

---

## Using X-Ray Middleware

X-Ray middleware integrates with HTTP requests in your application and can be used with frameworks like Flask, Django, etc.

### Example: Flask Integration

The example below shows how to integrate AWS X-Ray with a Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask
from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask.middleware import XRayMiddleware
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure the service name that will appear in X-Ray
xray_recorder.configure(service='MyApplication')

# Enable X-Ray middleware in Flask
XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder)
```

This setup ensures that all routes in the Flask application are monitored by AWS X-Ray.

---

### Example: Adding Custom Subsegments in Flask

The following example demonstrates how to create a custom subsegment within a route in a Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask
from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask.middleware import XRayMiddleware
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
import time

app = Flask(__name__)
xray_recorder.configure(service='MyApplication')
XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder)

# Default Flask route
@app.route("/process")
def process():
    # Create a custom subsegment with a personalized name
    with xray_recorder.in_subsegment('simulating-processing') as subsegment:
        time.sleep(1.5)  # Simulate processing
        subsegment.put_metadata('example_data', {'info': 'important value'}, 'custom')
    
    return "OK!"
```

This example creates a manual subsegment with AWS X-Ray within a route, allowing you to add custom metadata and simulate processing.

---

## Best Practices for Using AWS X-Ray

1. **Use meaningful service names**: Ensure that the service names configured in `xray_recorder` are descriptive and unique.
2. **Add custom metadata**: Use subsegments to add metadata that can help debug specific parts of your application.
3. **Monitor performance**: Regularly analyze traces to identify bottlenecks and optimize your application.
4. **Integrate with other AWS services**: Combine X-Ray with services like CloudWatch for enhanced monitoring and alerting.
